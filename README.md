# Challenge-2-Portfolio

A challenge for UT Coding Bootcamp to create a Professional Portfolio following a given criteria:

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## When the portfolio loads-- my name, recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, resume, and how to contact is illustrated.

## When one of my links in the navigation is clicked, it corresponds to the correct section.

## The first application is presented and clickable to the corresponding link. It is under construction until a project takes the place of it.

## The layout adapts and responds to various screen sizes.
